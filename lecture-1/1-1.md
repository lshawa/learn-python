## Variable Names 
- Can contain alphanumeric characters 
- a-z, A-Z, 0-9 

## Variable names must START with a letter: 

## These cannot be used as variable names: 
â˜… In addition, there are a number of Python keywords that cannot be used as variable names. These keywords are:

- and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, 
- exec, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, not, or,
- pass, print, raise, return, try, while, with, yield

- Note: Be aware of the keyword lambda, which could easily be a natural variable name in scientific program. But being a keyword, it cannot be used as a variable name


## A Python Interger is more than just an Integer
- single integer in Python actually contains four pieces:

- ob_refcnt, a reference count that helps Python silently handle memory allocation and deallocation
- ob_type, which encodes the type of the variable
- ob_size, which specifies the size of the following data members
- ob_digit, which contains the actual integer value that we expect the Python variable to represent

## Type of Variables 
1. float: 
```js
x=1.0
type(x) --> float 
```
2. booelan

3. strings 

4.  complex numbers: note the use of j to specify the imaginary part 
**I don't get it**

5. operators and comparisons: 


## Compund types: Strings, List and dictionaries 
1. Strings 
2. Lists 

## Operators and Comparisons 
1. **Arthimetic Operators**
